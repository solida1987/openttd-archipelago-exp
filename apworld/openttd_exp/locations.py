#  MISSION TEMPLATES
#  Each entry: (description_template, amount_min, amount_max, unit)
#
#  SPACING RULES (enforced in _generate_missions):
#  - No two missions of the same type+unit may have amounts closer than 5×
#    e.g. "Have X vehicles": 3 → next must be ≥15, then ≥75
#  - No exact duplicates (same type + same amount)
#  - "Buy a vehicle from the shop" is capped at 1 per difficulty level
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  PREDEFINED MISSION POOLS
#
#  Each difficulty has exactly 100 pre-written missions.  The generator
#  shuffles the pool and picks the first N entries — so no two missions of
#  the same session ever duplicate each other, and neighbouring amounts are
#  always well-spaced (because they were written that way up-front).
#
#  Format: (description_template, amount, unit, type_key)
#   - description_template: shown to player; {cargo} is filled at runtime
#   - amount: exact target value (already pre-spaced — no random roll needed)
#   - unit: used for C++ type matching / display
#   - type_key: canonical string C++ uses to identify the mission type
#
#  Named-destination missions ([Town] / [Industry near Town]) keep their
#  placeholder text; C++ resolves the actual name at session start.
#
#  EASY: 100 missions ordered by rough difficulty within each type group.
#        Types included: vehicles, trains, road vehicles, stations,
#        passengers, passengers_to_town, mail_to_town, towns, profit,
#        monthly profit, transport cargo, shop purchase.
